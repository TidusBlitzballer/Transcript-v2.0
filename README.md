# Transcript-v2.0

This program currently has a preset list of classes over a 4 year high school period.
The program asks the user for a final letter grade for each class: Letter grades must be single (ie. no A+ or B-) only the first character is retreived.

Still needing to be implemented: GPA calculations for individual years as well as total final GPA.  Must be calculated based on Character letter grades.

TODO: Implement file Read for grade input
TODO: Implement write to external file as opposed to piping from command line
